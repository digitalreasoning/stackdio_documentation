We are an open-source project and we depend on folks like you to help

help us out! If you find problems in our documentation or screencasts,
encounter bugs, or see some missing piece of functionality that would
make stackd.io that more awesome, kindly drop us a note or submit an
issue. If you do know how to code and you want to get your hands dirty,
take a shot at one of our outstanding issues and submit a pull request.
