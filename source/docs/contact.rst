Filing issues and feature requests
==================================

We want stackd.io to be solid, but there's always going to be issues to
fix and new features to enhance the product. If you find any problems or
would like to request a particular feature, feel free to head over to
`stackd.io's issue
tracker <https://github.com/stackdio/stackdio/issues>`__. Below are some
general guidelines.

Feature Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We definitely want this project to be better in every way, but sometimes
we just can't see the forest because of those trees. If you think of
something that would make stackd.io be more intuitive, easier, faster,
or efficient, we encourage you to `file a feature
request <https://github.com/stackdio/stackdio/issues>`__, but please
keep the following in mind:

1. Double-check that the feature hasn't already made its way into the
   tracker and/or been completed

2. After filing it, please be patient -- sometimes it might take a while
   for things to get prioritized, so don't be bummed that it's not
   available tomorrow ;)

3. As always, the quickest way to get your shiny new feature is to get
   your hands dirty and implement it yourself!

Bug Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you think you've found a bug, here's what we ask of you:

1. Check the `issue
   tracker <https://github.com/stackdio/stackdio/issues>`__ and/or
   `search for your
   issue <https://github.com/stackdio/stackdio/search?type=Issues>`__ to
   make sure we aren't already tracking the problem

2. See if you can reproduce the issue on the develop branch of the
   project to confirm we haven't already fixed the problem

3. Try to be as descriptive as possible when filing your issues. We'd
   like to know the operating system you're on, any stack traces you've
   seen in the logs, a good account of the steps required to reproduce
   the problem along with what you feel is the expected outcome.
   Providing more information is almost always better so we can quickly
   identify and fix the issue.

4. Be patient :)

5. Optionally, it would be fantastic if you could help us out and fix
   the problem yourself...if you're brave enough, see the `Countributor
   Guide <contributor_guide.md>`__ on contributing to the project.

Usage Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage questions are best handled in one of the following ways:

-  Asking a question on the IRC channel
-  Emailing the contributors, especially those who have been recently
   active on the project.

Long term development comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Long term development tasks will usually have a branch opened on the
main repository, along with a pull request back into develop. This is
the place to make comments on the development cycle for that feature.
